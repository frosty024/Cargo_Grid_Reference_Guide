# Cargo Grid Reference Guide

A summary sheet of existing Cargo Grids for Star Citizen ships and Freight Elevators...

This is a fork of Erecco's work. I merely share updates/additions for new/changed ships and/or cargo capacities that I've done for my own use while awaiting Erecco's official update. All credit goes to Erecco for his original work!

My latest update is available here:<br>

**NOTES**<br>
- **Accuracy is _not_ guaranteed**<br>
It's entirely possible that my updates are not 100% accurate. I do not own/fly all of the ships in this guide. I also cannot account for the original work in this guide.

- **Isometric cargo grid representation**<br>
True to the original, the point of view is still from behind looking forward, since most ships are loaded from the ramp at the rear.

- **Optimized loading configuration**<br>
Time is money! Since moving 8 1SCU containers takes much longer than moving 1 8SCU container, the depicted loading configurations represent the least amount of containers needed to fill the entire cargo hold.

- **Size-specific container colouring**<br>
The yellow/blue distinction has caused much confusion and many of you have requested this for easier interpretation.

- **Container size labels**<br>
For improved readability, all containers are now labeled top/front/side.

- **Quantity**<br>
A list on the lefthand side shows the quantity for each container of the depicted loading configuration, also a quite popular request.

- **Ground vehicles**<br>
It appears that with base-building, cargo capable ground vehicle are becoming more important, so they are included now.

- **Freight elevator grids**<br>
Added all freight elevators grids, found around outposts, distribution centers, and hangars.
