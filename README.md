# Cargo Grid Reference Guide

A summary sheet of existing Cargo Grids for Star Citizen ships and Freight Elevators...

This is a fork of Erecco's work. I merely share updates/additions for new/changed ships and/or cargo capacities that I've done for my own use while awaiting Erecco's official update. All credit goes to Erecco for his original work!

My latest update is available here:<br>
